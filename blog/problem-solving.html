          <h3>Problem Solving</h3> 

          <p>
              If I get blocked on a simple problem it’s usually because I’m thinking too broadly and perhaps losing perspective on issue at hand. This also occurs when I’m trying to solve other problems in the background or the next problem before I have resolved the first. It also occurs when I feel I simply don’t have the tools to solve the problem and need to do significant research to understand the problem. 
              
              No recent problems have been solved in elegant ways (lol). But I can accept this while I learn Javascript. I need to be tooled-up before I can work with Javascript in an efficient way. When I do solve problems in what might be described an elegant way, I am able to apply previous experience, appropriate skills, and a focus on the solution rather than become distracted by frustrations.  
              
              Problem solving notes:

              Pseudocode is a good strategy to check one’s own logic and not be distracted by technical problems, however, and a reasonably high level of understanding of the problem is required. This has not yet always been the case with code challenges faced in this sprint. And so research and dialogue + testing might be required to further understand the problem before a logical solution can be established. 
              
              Trying something is a natural instinct. Usually doesn’t work, but learning can happen, or not. Still needs to be methodical. 
              
              Rubber ducky method is interesting, however I learn through dialogue, I canon simply receive information. 
              
              Reading error messages will be more useful when I have broader understanding of the syntax.

              I’m beginning to learn about Console.logging. I can see how this would be a good first step… 
              
              Googling is fraught at my current level of understanding. It very much depends on the context. For example, If I know what I’m searching for, then it can provide and instant solution. However, If I don’t have the correct terms or structure in my search string, then it can become very inefficient. Other times the I can’t be sure if the answer provided is relevant to my context and so this can become a rabbit hole of despair! Google will be a better resource as my understanding Javascript expands. In the meantime, dialogue with someone who understand the context of my code problem is far more efficient and conducive to learning. 
              
              Reflecting is good to package thoughts / frustrations and stop them spilling over into the next Sprint/challenge.
