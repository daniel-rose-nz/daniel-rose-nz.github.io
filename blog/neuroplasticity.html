        <p>
            > Always focus on the solution and try to avoid dwelling on the roadblock or frustration. Develop skills in small but
            steady increments so I can demonstrate the ability to improve to myself at regular frequencies.
        </p>
        <p>
            > Be open, and accept the process as it is. Focus on upskilling rather than relying on natural ability. Demonstrate
            increased understanding to myself on a regular basis. Don't identify with what others say about me, or past experiences
            where I have been stereotyped.
