            Ethical situation - slightly humorous non-work related interaction: I recently purchased a second hand guitar from TradeMe. 
            The gentleman who sold it to me sent me the wrong guitar - actually much better than the one I thought I had purchased. 
            I had assumed it was a deliberate act. However, a few days later he emailed me in a panic demanding I return his beloved guitar that he had mistakenly shipped to me. 
            I couldn't quite understand how such a error could have been made and so for a brief moment I considered keeping it as by then I had somehow become emotionally attached to it. 
            But of course it was his guitar so I sent it back to him - he was relieved, and I was happy for him… albeit dismayed; apparently he's a professional courier driver.

            I’m a 6th generation New Zealand, however I have had reflected back to me that I hold what some consider to be Asian-influenced sensibilities, 
            which had earlier identified while working in China prior to the Covid19 era.
            In terms of identity, I wouldn't say I identify with any exclusive culture, except as to say I find resonance in selected values emphasized within traditional Chinese culture, such as simplicity, 
            patience, and compassion for one's fellow human beings. Being raised on the South Island, I have an affinity with wider, open spaces, and a sense of personal 
            freedom - including freedom of thought and rigourous critical discussion.

            In terms of learning, my strength would be that I'm always focused on a solution to whatever problem is presented, 
            albeit admit I sometimes lapse into victimhood when I haven't had enough coffee… Focusing on the task can be a challenge if I'm not engaged enough, 
            or haven’t had coffee… I have a passion for efficiency, If I performing a task which seems unnecessarily cumbersome, I consider how someone has likely already 
            found a way to remove unnecessary labour, and so seek a better way rather than soldering on as cost to my own time, energy and sanity.

            An example of running into problems with others. As a photography / visual culture teacher, I have found developing course content collaboratively is tricky. 
            Where there is disagreement around which content to include, tension arises largely due to nobody being overly keen to take on additional workload, and so this 
            can restrict the creation of new content which might require a degree of upskilling. It's a tough one to fully resolve, but I have found that if I demonstrate a 
            potential addition to the curriculum and it objectively satisfies the learning outcomes and my colleagues are able to appropriate it to their teaching style, 
            then this can be accepted. I guess I would try to emphasize how the new content could benefit them and their students through demonstration so they can then 
            form their own position on the matter, or raise roadblocks, which are great because I then have a defined problem to resolve.
