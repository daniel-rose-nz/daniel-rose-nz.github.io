        <P><b>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</b> <br>
            I aim to complete Web Dev Bootcamp, and then either begin developing online tools for cross-cultural communication or establish a small web design business - potential further training via iLoveCreatives depending on my strategy for further learning and tools I decide to use going forward.  I'd like to work across Asia and bring contemporary knowledge to developing countries and help connect Eastern ideas to NZ, where appropriate. I’m interested in education and aesthetics. 
            </P>
            <p><b>Description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</b><br>
            Strengths: I'm good at making connections within systems of thought. I'm patient, and calm in the face of challenge. I search for efficient methods when faced with complexity and a demanding workload. I emphasise effectiveness over fulfilling established requirements, which may or may not be 100% effective to the goal (possibly also a weakness in some cases). Weaknesses would be around sustained focus, and it remains to be tested as to whether I have the toughness for sustained coding over long durations. So far I enjoy it, but I may need to find balance beyond strictly writing code. 
            </p> 
            <p><b>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</b><br>
            Always keen to develop more effective learning methods. I'd like to develop my team skills and working with others, especially where they may be differences of strategy. 
            As I'm new to coding, establishing an effective time management strategy will be both a challenge and opportunity. I think this is something that will have to be updated as I progress as I have not yet practiced sustained coding. However, I have now finished my work contract and from Sprint 3/4 will be able to learn full-time. In terms feeling like I'm failing or frustrated - my plan is to avoid falling into victimhood by shifting attention to the solution. </p>
            <p><b>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</b><br>
            My first instincts when faced with a roadblock is to ask for help, however this is not as 
            immediate when learning online, compared to a classroom. So far, I have primary sought feedback to 
            confirm I'm tracking in the right direction and have not missed something. So rather I have used facilitator 
            or fellow students as a guide rather than a resource for solutions. 
        </p><p><b>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</b><br>
            Hopefully fast feedback and help when I'm confused. Also honest feedback about my strengths and weaknesses.</p> 
            <p><b> Scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</b><br>
            I may have juggle some child-care arrangements, potentially Friday afternoons, however all going to plan this won't be an issue for the duration of Bootcamp. 
        </p><p><b>These elements do not need to be structured as they are in this list. You should put them together in the way that you feel they are most clearly communicated.</b>
            <br>Ok thanks :)</p>
