    <p>> What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
        <br><br>
        I'm most focussed when the working at the edge of my current knowledge and learning new skills.
        When I can't solve a problem and see no way forward it affects me negatively and I begin to seek an easier path.
        I aim for a growth mindset and notice when myself or others do not.
    </p>
    <p>
        > What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?
        <br><br>
        Values are malleable and can be adjusted to the context (a bit like programming). That is to say it's best not to have
        rigid or fixed values when working within new territories.
        Empathy for those who would use the the product of the code is critical.
        Self awareness helps regulate the learning process.
    </p>
    <p>
        > What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
        <br><br>
        I can't say I'm surprised as such. Completing an MFA in recent years developed a lot of these skills, but I look forward
        to further exploring this in the context of code.
    </p>
    <p>
        > What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
        <br><br>
        Perhaps objectivity in regards to self-reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
        > Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development
        bootcamp course?
        <br><br>
        Because assholes are horrible to work with! Lol
    </p>
    <p>
        > Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time?
    <br><br>
        Not a waste of time, it offers a break from the code and a time to assess the self.
    </p>
    <p>
        > Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.
        <br><br>
        Maybe! I need to spend the break before Bootcamp reviewing the fundamentals of programming so I can contextualize new
        learning and generate a conceptual framework for more efficient learning in the future.
